Add a simple Commit and push button next to the open in terminal button that allows you to commit and push the changes made for that session.

What: A Commit and push button in the agent-detail to allow for easy commit/push using Git tools.
Why: This way you don't have to open a terminal/editor/seperate git tool to make simple git pushes
