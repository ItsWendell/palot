### Minor Changes

- [`e6d4908`](https://github.com/ItsWendell/palot/commit/e6d4908ee0be6a172d07035ce41bc4a71b9cd7cf) Thanks [@ItsWendell](https://github.com/ItsWendell)! - Add universal config converter with Cursor support and onboarding migration flow. Rename cc2oc packages to configconv/configconv-cli to reflect bidirectional conversion between Claude Code, Cursor, and OpenCode. Includes Cursor settings scanning, conversation history migration, and an improved desktop onboarding experience with migration preview and completion steps.
